## Parallel Programming Class Project üîç
<p> For this project I used the ICBYTES library. The ICBYTES library is a simplified C++ library for developing GUI interfaces and graphics compatible with Visual Studio 2022, developed by the instructor of the parallel programming course.  It includes examples and various utilities for graphics programming that can be ideal for projects involving animations, interactive graphics, game development or diagnostic tools.</p>
